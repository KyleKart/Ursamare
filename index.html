<h3 id="what-is-ursamare">What is Ursamare?</h2>
<p>Ursamare (BearSea) is a friendly bear-like species.</p>
<h3 id="habitat-and-living">Habitat and living</h2>
<p>Ursamares make their homes around bodies of water. While they cannot survive underwater, Ursamares have developed the ability to build watertight structures and sealed houses, using materials such as ice and glass.</p>
<h3 id="survival-adaptations">Survival Adaptations</h2>
<p>Ursamares are able to survive in colder environments, thanks to their thick insulating layer of fur and blubber, as well as their ability to regulate their body temperature.
These adaptations allow them to thrive and enjoy the beauty and resources of aquatic environments, creating a unique and fascinating lifestyle, unlike other species.</p>
